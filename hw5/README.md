# Image downloader

Firstly, I write python script which just download random images with [site](https://thissnackdoesnotexist.com/)

It works very slow (30 images can downloads about one minute)

Secondly, I learn asynchronous idea and using it in old script. Now it works much faster (30 images can downloads in 6 seconds)
